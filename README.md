# FinalYearProject
Collection of Scripts, files and documents for my Final Year Btech project on information flow through social networks (like twitter).

v1.0 - contains the initial presentation and report that was created after the initial study, also contains the first program I wrote to draw the graph using twitter accounts and the list of their followers, following. The program took a list of accounts as input. 
I was using an online tool to grab tweets from #hashtags on twitter then extracting the accounts which tweeted to make the list of nodes for this program. 


v2.0 - will make a complete standalone program to just accept a #hashtag. It will then extract tweets, retweets and graw graph using both the details.

v2.1 - will try to find list of accounts that are common between specific hashtags in order to identify groups of people working together.
